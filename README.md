Solving flappy bird with simple RL algorithms

This repository applies simple reinforcement learning
(RL) methods to the Text Flappy Bird (TFB) game environment.

The TFB environment is a simplified version of the original Flappy Bird game. It consists of a bird that can jump and a set of pipes that the bird must avoid. The bird receives a reward of +1 for each time step it survives and a reward of -100 if it collides with a pipe. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or when the bird reaches the end of the game screen.

The goal of this assignment is to implement and compare two RL agents, namely Monte Carlo Control and Sarsa(Î»), to tackle the TFB environment.
